###Introduction 

This following design report covers the late term assignment for Software Engineering course at Reykjav√≠k University. We developed the game Tic Tac Toe as a web-application which runs in a web browser. Game logic was programmed in Java. We will make short description of how the game works, for other system details look at other reports which are included in the project.

- Development Manual: What software is required and how to get the project to build on a fresh machine.

- Administration Manual: How to set the project up and run it on a fresh machine.
The method used to code was Test driven development. A test was written, commited and the function written and commited with proper refactoring.
